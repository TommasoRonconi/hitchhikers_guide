# The Hitchhiker's guide to not screw up

* **Lecture 0**: Approaching the terminal, understanding the shell, familiarizing with bash;
* **Lecture 1**: Git usage for incremental development and version control, remote storage and cooperative development with GitHub;
* **Lecture 2**: Processor architecture, parallel execution and cluster usage.

In this repo you will find the exercises of the course.

They are divided into

* [`exercise0_bash`](exercise0_bash/): it is mostly a demonstration of what a batch and script are. Once you have cloned the repository into your local environment you can simply go through the description present within the sub-directory and try some of the commands that are suggested therein. I have gone through these during Lecture 0 in the directory description you will find some more details with respect to what I told you in class.
* [`exercise1_git`](exercise1_git/): in this directory you will find the text of the **collaborative project** exercise (end of Lecture 1). The exercise has to be performed outside the root directory of this repository working in groups of two.
